## What is eZ Platform Enterprise Edition?
*eZ Platform Enterprise Edition* is commercial CMS (Content Management System) software developed by eZ Systems.

*eZ Platform Enterprise Edition* derives from *[eZ Platform](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform)*. It is composed of a set of bundles. eZ Platform Enterprise Edition, like eZ Platform, is built on top of the Symfony framework (Full Stack). It has been in development since 2014.

In short, Enterprise comes with addtional features and services that extend eZ Platform functionality for media industry and team collaboration.

## Installation

NOTE: *For simplified installation, consider using [eZ Launchpad](https://ezsystems.github.io/launchpad/) which takes care of the whole server setup for you.*

Installation instructions below are for installing a clean installation of eZ Platform Enterprise Edition in latest version with _no_ demo content or demo website.
Full installation documentation is kept current [in the online docs](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/getting_started/install_using_composer/), and includes
instructions on installing other distributions _(like [ezplatform "clean"](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform) and [ezplatform-ee-demo](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-ee-demo) enterprise edition)_, or other versions.

#### Prerequisites

These instructions assume you have already installed:
- PHP _(7.1 or higher)_
- Web Server _(Recommeneded: Apache / Nginx. Use of php's built in development server is also possible)_
- Database server _(MySQL 5.5+ or MariaDB 10.0+)_
- [Composer](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/getting_started/about_composer/)
- Git _(for development)_

For further information [on requirements see online doc](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/getting_started/requirements_and_system_configuration/).


#### Install eZ Platform _(clean enterprise distribution)_

Assuming you have prerequisites sorted out, you can get the install up and running with the following commands in your terminal:

``` bash
composer create-project --keep-vcs ezsystems/ezplatform-ee ezplatform ^2
cd ezplatform
```

_Note: If  composer is installed localy instead of globally, the first command will start with `php composer.phar`._

During the installation process you will be asked to input things like database host name, login, password, etc.
They will be placed in `<ezplatform>/app/config/parameters.yml`.

Next you will receive instructions on how to install data into the database, and how to run a simplified dev server using the `bin/console server:run` command.
_Tip: For a more complete and better performing setup using Apache or Nginx, read up on how to [install eZ Platform manually](https://doc.ezplatform.com/en/latest/getting_started/install_manually/)._

## Issue tracker
Submitting bugs, improvements and stories is possible on https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZEE.
If you discover a security issue, please see how to responsibly report such issues on https://doc.ez.no/Security.

## Backwards compatibility
eZ Platform aims to be **100% content compatible** with eZ Publish 5.x, 4.x and 3.x *(introduced in 2002)*, meaning that content in those versions of the CMS can be upgraded using
[online documentation](http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Upgrading) to eZ Platform.

Unlike eZ Publish Platform 5.x, eZ Platform does not ship with eZ Publish Legacy (4.x). But this is available by optional installing [LegacyBridge](https://github.com/ezsystems/LegacyBridge/releases/) to allow eZ Platform and eZ Publish Legacy to run together, this is only recommended for migration use cases and not for new installations.
